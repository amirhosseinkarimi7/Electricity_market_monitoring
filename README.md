Electricity Generation Analysis Tool for Highest-Load and Lowest-Load Hours
This project is to create a tool that will analyze and visualize electricity generation data by fuel type, time of day, and load. The tool will produce two charts: one showing the share of electricity produced by each fuel type during the highest-load hour of each day, and one showing the same statistic for the lowest-load hour of the day

## Summary of Findings for 2020 data
This analysis of electricity generation data from 2020 shows that coal, natural gas, and wind are the three most important fuel types for generating electricity during both the highest-load and lowest-load hours of each day. This was also the case for 2017 data. These three types of fuel have a combined share of 88.6% of electricity market during Highest-Load hours and 89.2% during the Lowest-Load hours. However, there have been some changes in the relative importance of these three fuel types compared to 2017. In particular, the share of wind energy has increased, while the share of coal has decreased.

### Clean vs. Non-Clean Energy Sources

Clean energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, played a more important role compared to 2017 data in electricity generation during lowest-load hours. On average, clean energy sources generated 42.3% of the load during Lowest-Load hours in 2020 (up from 31.6% in 2017). Also clean energy sources generated 33.7% of the load during highest-load hours in 2020 (up from 25.7% in 2017) mostly due to higher wind usage. 

### Correlation Between Wind and Natural Gas

The analysis also suggests that there is a negative correlation between wind and natural gas. This means that when wind generation is high, natural gas generation is typically low, and vice versa. This correlation is more pronounced during highest-load hours than during lowest-load hours. The figures seem to suggest that the availability of wind as a source of generating electricity has a seasonal component. 


### Directions for possible future investigations

This analysis provides a starting point for understanding the dynamics of electricity generation during high-load and low-load hours, as well as the relationship between wind and natural gas generation. However, there are a number of areas where further research is needed. For example, it would be useful to investigate the following questions:

What are the factors that are driving the growth of wind energy?
What are the factors that improve the integration of wind energy into the electricity grid?
How have recent government policies affected the utilization of clean energy sources in 2022-2023?

By conducting further investigations in these areas, we can develop a better understanding of how to transition to a more sustainable and reliable electricity system.
